There is a repo that maintains a master list of
all the language+TF repos, their docker image name,
and the docker image they are built FROM in the first
line of their Dockerfiles.

Each language+TF repo as part of its .travis.yml script
checks that the docker image it is built FROM 
(which is reads directly from the first line of its own
Dockerfile) is recorded correctly in this master list.

Each language+TF repo, as part of its .travis.yml script
uses this master-list (eg curls it) and uses it to find
what other language+TF repos it needs to notify 
(since they depend on it and it has just changed and
successfully built a new image and pushed it to dockerhub).

This functionality could be baked into a simple docker image
that the .travis.yml script uses directly.

This means I can stick with the javascript based notification
I'm using although I should upgrade to using a POST which
the travis API v3 now allows. See
https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/triggering-builds/
